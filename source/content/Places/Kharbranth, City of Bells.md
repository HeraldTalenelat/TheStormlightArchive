- City state in the south
- Taravangian is its king: Eldery with a wispy white beard and pale grey eyes.
- Has the Palanaeum, one of the, if not the largest library on Roshar, bigger even than The Holy Enclave in Valath. Contains over 700.00 separate texts, and costs 1000 sapphire broams to enter.
- `One book she’d read claimed that Kharbranth had been founded way back into the shadowdays, years before the Last Desolation. That would make it old indeed. Thousands of years old, created before the terrors of the Hierocracy, long before—even—the Recreance. Back when Voidbringers with bodies of stone were said to have stalked the land.`
