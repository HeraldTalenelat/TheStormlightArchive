- Szeths homeplace
- Thruthless
	- Is it s social lower class (parece un adjetivo despectivo), maybe something related to the channeling of Stormlight?
	- Truthless cannot kill themselves (sembla com un tema de honor samurai aquesta region, aunque Raul diga que no)

# Religion
- It’s profane to use Stormlight for mundane things, such as lightening, jewlry etc (`“How could this men use something so sacred for mere illumination”`)
- Using stone for building is profane too.  Szeth calls Alethi “stonewalkers” although this probably applies to any nation outside Shinovar. Shinovar stands alone on this matter?
	- `Like much of Roshar—save for certain coastal regions—Kharbranth was built on raw, unbroken stone` 

- Killing is one of the greatest sins
- To Szeths people a dying request was sacred
