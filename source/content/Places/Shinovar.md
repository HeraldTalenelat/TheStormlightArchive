- Szeths homeplace
- Thruthless
	- Is it s social lower class (parece un adjetivo despectivo), maybe something related to the channeling of Stormlight?
	- Truthless cannot kill themselves (sembla com un tema de honor samurai aquesta region, aunque Raul diga que no)
		- `“I am forbidden to take my own life,” Szeth said softly in the Bav language. “As Truthless, it is the nature of my suffering to be forbidden the taste of death by my own hand.”`
- They look like kids
	- `Szeth looked up. “Kurp” meant child in the local Bav dialect. Szeth was accustomed to such pejorative labels. Though he was in his thirty-fifth year—and his seventh year since being named Truthless—his people’s large, round eyes, shorter stature, and tendency toward baldness led Easterners to claim they looked like children.`
- They are not violent at all
	- `“He’s Shin. Won’t hurt a cremling.”`

- Oathstone:
	- `“I am required to tell you,” Szeth said quietly, “that you are holding my Oathstone. So long as you possess it, you are my master.”`
	- `The man plucked a twinkling, sphere-sized chunk of rock from the hand of the man counting the spheres. It was fairly ordinary, a simple piece of rock with a few quartz crystals set into it and a rusty vein of iron on one side.`
	- `“I must obey you,” Szeth said. “In all things, though I will not follow an order to kill myself.” He also couldn’t be ordered to give up his Blade, but there was no need to mention that at the moment.`

# Religion
- It’s profane to use Stormlight for mundane things, such as lightening, jewlry etc (`“How could this men use something so sacred for mere illumination”`)
- Using stone for building is profane too.  Szeth calls Alethi “stonewalkers” although this probably applies to any nation outside Shinovar. Shinovar stands alone on this matter?
	- `Like much of Roshar—save for certain coastal regions—Kharbranth was built on raw, unbroken stone` 

- Killing is one of the greatest sins
- To Szeths people a dying request was sacred
