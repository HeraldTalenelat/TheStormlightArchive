# Social Structure
Social status based on eye color:
- **Lighteyes** (blue, green, yellow or light grey, maybe others p88) are upper class. They are called Brightlords/BrightnessIn and are typically richer. In battle, they wear armor, have horses and an honor guard, but aren’t good commanders
- **Darkeyed** are lower class, and are prohibited to wield swords (very very strict). They can still be high ranking citizens, with honored positions such as the royal guard.
