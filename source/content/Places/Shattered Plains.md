# Important
- They break the treaty with Garvilar, which acording to the king “Makes no sense”
- Parshendi live in the Shattered Plains, a place were Alethi need bridges to move around, however at no point in time is mentioned that they use the same technique. Furthermore their army squad seems way smaller than the Alethi one. How do they traverse the Shattered Plains? Secret tunels? Creatures/mounts? Body strengthening magic to jump?
- What is [[Alethkar]] looking for in the Shattered Plains? The [[Alethkar#Other Facts|Vengance Pact]] seems like an excuse for something deeper like those “large rockbuds”:
	- `After winning, soldiers start picking through the corpses of the dead Parshendi, looking for something. Harvesting equipment, maybe?`
	- `The plateau they’d fought on seemed exactly like the others they’d crossed. The only thing that was different here was that there was a large lump of…something in the center of the plateau. It looked like an enormous rockbud, perhaps some kind of chrysalis or shell, a good twenty feet tall. One side had been hacked open, exposing slimy innards. He hadn’t noticed it on the initial charge; the archers had demanded all of his attention.`
	- `He still didn’t know why they fought on those blustering plateaus. Something about those large chrysalises. They had gemstones at their hearts, apparently. But what did that have to do with the Vengeance Pact?`
	- `The old Kaladin might have wondered why the armies didn’t work harder to defend the bridges. There’s something wrong here! a voice inside him said. You’re missing part of the puzzle. They waste resources and bridgeman lives. They don’t seem to care about pushing inward and assaulting the Parshendi. They just fight pitched battles on plateaus, then come back to the camps and celebrate. Why? WHY?`

# Random facts
- Parshendi means “Parshmen who can think” in Alethi. 
- `White clothing for a killer was a tradition among the Parshendi. Although Szeth had not asked, his masters had explained why.White to be bold. White to not blend into the night. White to give warning.For if you were going to assassinate a man, he was entitled to see you coming.`
