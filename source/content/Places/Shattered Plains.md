# Important

- Parshendi are not humans?!?!
	- `The Parshendi—as always—had left their dead behind. Even when they won, they reportedly left their dead. The humans sent back bridge crews and soldiers to burn their dead and send their spirits to the afterlife, where the best among them would fight in the Heralds’ army.`

- They break the treaty with Garvilar, which acording to the king “Makes no sense”
- Parshendi live in the Shattered Plains, a place were Alethi need bridges to move around, however at no point in time is mentioned that they use the same technique. Furthermore their army squad seems way smaller than the Alethi one. How do they traverse the Shattered Plains? Secret tunels? Creatures/mounts? Body strengthening magic to jump?
- What is [[Alethkar]] looking for in the Shattered Plains? The [[Alethkar#Other Facts|Vengance Pact]] seems like an excuse for something deeper like those “large rockbuds”:
	- `After winning, soldiers start picking through the corpses of the dead Parshendi, looking for something. Harvesting equipment, maybe?`
	- `The plateau they’d fought on seemed exactly like the others they’d crossed. The only thing that was different here was that there was a large lump of…something in the center of the plateau. It looked like an enormous rockbud, perhaps some kind of chrysalis or shell, a good twenty feet tall. One side had been hacked open, exposing slimy innards. He hadn’t noticed it on the initial charge; the archers had demanded all of his attention.`
	- `He still didn’t know why they fought on those blustering plateaus. Something about those large chrysalises. They had gemstones at their hearts, apparently. But what did that have to do with the Vengeance Pact?`
	- `The old Kaladin might have wondered why the armies didn’t work harder to defend the bridges. There’s something wrong here! a voice inside him said. You’re missing part of the puzzle. They waste resources and bridgeman lives. They don’t seem to care about pushing inward and assaulting the Parshendi. They just fight pitched battles on plateaus, then come back to the camps and celebrate. Why? WHY?`
- Want the assasination to be seen: 
	- `Kill, destroy, and cut your way to the king. Be seen doing it. Leave witnesses. Wounded but alive….`
- They can jump over cliffs:
	- `The eastern and southern edges were impassable—the plateaus there were weathered to the point that many were little more than spires, and the Parshendi could not jump the distance between them. `
- They can cape highstormes
- ¼ of them are dead
	- `Even though they’d killed plenty of Parshendi—as many as a quarter of their originally estimated forces were dead`
- Not originally form the shattered plains?
	- ` Obviously the Parshendi had expected to be besieged here. They’d prepared supply dumps and had been ready to move their entire population to the Shattered Plains, where they could use these Heralds-forsaken chasms and plateaus like hundreds of moats and fortifications.`

# Random facts
- Parshendi means “Parshmen who can think” in Alethi. 
- `White clothing for a killer was a tradition among the Parshendi. Although Szeth had not asked, his masters had explained why.White to be bold. White to not blend into the night. White to give warning.For if you were going to assassinate a man, he was entitled to see you coming.`
