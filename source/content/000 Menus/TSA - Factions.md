# Ardents

A faction of devouts to Vorin Theology. They control Soulcasting and Soulcasters. Ardents can t own anything, and thus can t be paid (Aside from Soulcasters?)
- `How it must grate on the ardents that such a powerful, holy relic was in the hands of someone outside the ardentia. And a heretic no less!`
- `Like most ardents, the aged man had a shaved head and a long beard. His simple grey robes were tied with a brown sash.`

Ardents travel the land, helping people with their Glories and Callings
- `They had traveled his lands and visited the villages, ministering to the people, helping them reach Points in their Glories and Callings.`
