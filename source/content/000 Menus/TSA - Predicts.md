# Solid Predicts

- **Shallan has a Shardblade:** Casi que no es ni un predict
	- Un secreto, escondido a 10 heartbeats, mas claro que el agua: `She raised her freehand to her head, suddenly overwhelmed by the weight of House Davar’s situation, her part in it, and the secret she now carried, hidden ten heartbeats away.`
	- Shallan memory, alguien que recuerda tiene lo que es claramente una Shardblade: `Nan Balat bruised, his coat torn. A long, silvery sword in her hand, sharp enough to cut stones as if they were water.`
- **Honor is one of the Shards, but there is at least two, one of which has killed Honor:** Quiza en TSA las reglas cambian, pero basandose en Mistborn, que cosa sino otra esquiarla podria matar a Honor?
	- Episode 2: Honor is dead 
	- Kaladin: `Honor died eight months ago`
	- La palabra honor se menciona 500 veces en la primera parte que hemos leido
- **Dalinar cheeseando su promesa  a Renarin y no dandole la shardblade** (predict en el chat de raul)
- **Gavilar tiene una piedra negra** rara, que va a usar para algo o tiene algun **poder que desconocemos**. **Para evitarlo, los Parshendi lo asesinasn**, aunk no consiguem pillar la piedra (tampoco parece que la quieran dado que no ordenan a szeth que la coja, asi que quiza no sabian que Gailar tenia la piedra). En cualquier caso la piedra es algo podereoso, y contiene una especie de luz negra? Algo relacionado con el vacio?
	- Rey sospechando de restares, thaidakar, sadeas
	- Sorprendiendose de que lo hacen los parshendi
	- Segun Carlos los parshendi quieren la guerra y por eso mataron al rey para provocarla. El motivo es que quieren que se desarrolle una guerra en las Shattered Plains, seguramente porque asi trigerean deathrattles que son visiones importantes para ellos. Desde mi POV no es que quieran hacer la guerra ahi en concreto y lo de los deathrattles me parece un porraco gordo, simplemente es un sitio muy bueno para defender cuando te enfrentas a una fuerza superior.
	- Finalmente Carlos dice que los Parshendi quieren algo de debajo de las Shattered Plains, que quiza hay algo debajo de ellas. No me parece mala teoria, ya hice predict en la sesion 1 de que las Shattered Plains parecian un crater de un meteorito o como mucho el centro de una explosion enorme. En caso de que fuera lo primero, podria ser que el meteorito tubiera algo de valor sin duda.
- **Spren are parts of the Shard/Shards of Roshar**, just as humans had part of the shards power in misstborn
- **Vedelev is one of the Heralds**: No creo que sea tampoco ningun secreto sus nombres, pero lo mencionan cursing asi que most likely uno de los Heraldos
	- `By Vedelev's golden keys, Brightness!`

# Ideas
No los considero predicts como tal, pero detalles menores o ideas en mente


- Parshmendi (more info here [[Shattered Plains#Important]])
	- Why did they break the treaty? Something to do with Honor’s death? 
	- What is Alethkar looking for in the Shattered Plains? Seems of relevance to go to war in such an uncomfrotable place
	- How do Parshmendi traverse this terrain (why not used by Alethi?)? Secret tunels? Creatures/mounts (not described so far + not used by alethi)? Body strengthening magic to jump?
		- Confirmed in the second part they jump, so they must have some sort of enhancing magic?
- **Keep an eye on number 10:** algo pasa aqui, a Sanderson le gustan estos detallitos e igual que metio todo lo del 16 en Mistborn aqui hay algo con el 10.
	- Ten Heralds, 
	- Ten gemstones
	- Ten Essences
	- Ten Highprinces
	- Ten heartbeats to summon a shardblade
	- El altar de los templos Vorin a 10ft de altura
	- 10 Honorblades
	- Ten fundamentals Glyphs
	- Ten orders.
- Check the chapter intros (**Deathrattles** dijo Raul). Some type of vision people have before dying? Someone is recording the facts so it might be important
- Several types of blood: red, violet organe
- **Ten Essences**
	- `Each of the Ten Essences had an analogous part of the human body—blood for liquid, hair for wood, and so forth. The eyes were associated with crystal and glass. The windows into a person’s mind and spirit.`
- **The Passions**, pagan superstition
	- `But I do knwo the Passions`, `The Passions. Pagan superstition`
- [[Gavilar Kholin]] says “The most important words a man can say”. Something related to the second book, “Words of Radiance?”. This book might also be related to the Knights Radiant?
	- `Brother you must find the most important words a man can say`
- [[Gavilar Kholin]] gives a strange object to szeth
	- `Gavilar coughed, hand quivering, reaching toward his chest and fumbling at a pocket. He pulled out a small crystalline sphere tied to a chain. “You must take this. They must not get it.”`
- [[Kaladin]], a **reencarnation**?
- Confirmed [[TSA - Magic#Shardblades|shardbearers]]:
	- [[Elhokar Kholin]] - [[Sunraiser]]
	- [[Dalinar Kholin]] - [[Oathbringer]]
	- [[Adolin Kholin]]
	- [[Szeth]] - [[Szeth’s Shardblade]]
	- [[Shallan]]
	- Shardbearer that kills Cenn - [[Unnamed Shardblade]]
	- Gavilars sword - [[Gavilar’s Shardblade]]
The **Origin** is were storms start, and they become weaker and weaker the further they travel, so Shinovar might barely have any storms?
- `looking eastward, toward the Origin—the distant, the unseen place where highstorms began.`
- `His father said no ship had ever sailed for the Origin of Storms and returned safely`
- The letter in chapter epigraphs: 
	- Ati era un buen hombre, y aun asi su esquirla (Ruina) lo convirtio y transformo en alguien malo
	- *Ryse, sera el portador de la esquirla que se ha cargado a Honor.* 
	- Es esquirla es algo malo de cojones, y Rayse ya era un hijo de puta antes de pillarla, asi que el autor esta asustado de que coño sera este tio ahora
	- La conversacion es entre dios tios poderosos, uno de ellos reptiliano? que aboga por no intervenir (seguramente en Roshar con Rayse y su asesinato) mientras que el autor si que quiere intervenir. Personajes con este nivel de conocimiento no han salido muchos, y justamente uno de los que entra en esa descirpcion ya ha sido mencionado haciendo cositas por Roshar: *Hoid, asi que es una alta posibilidad de que sea él.*

```
Old friend, I hope this missive finds you well. Though, as you are now essentially immortal, I would guess that wellness on your part is something of a given.

I realize that you are probably still angry. That is pleasant to know. Much as your perpetual health, I have come to rely upon your dissatisfaction with me. It is one of the cosmere’s great constants, I should think.

Let me first assure you that the element is quite safe. I have found a good home for it. I protect its safety like I protect my own skin, you might say.

You do not agree with my quest. I understand that, so much as it is possible to understand someone with whom I disagree so completely.
Might I be quite frank? Before, you asked why I was so concerned. It is for the following reason:

Ati was once a kind and generous man, and you saw what became of him. Rayse, on the other hand, was among the most loathsome, crafty, and dangerous individuals I had ever met.

He holds the most frightening and terrible of all of the Shards. Ponder on that for a time, you old reptile, and tell me if your insistence on nonintervention holds firm. Because I assure you, Rayse will not be similarly inhibited.
```

The Alethi War Codes



The Heraldic forces
- `When the king had been given the initial estimate, he had brushed aside the deaths, indicating that they’d be rewarded for their valor with positions in the Heraldic Forces above.`


`Most gemhearts were harvested quite differently than the one had been today. Sometime during the strange life cycle of the chasmfiends, they sought the western side of the Plains, where the plateaus were wider. They climbed up onto the tops and made a rocky chrysalis, waiting for the coming of a highstorm.During that time, they were vulnerable. You just had to get to the plateau where it rested, break into its chrysalis with some mallets or a Shardblade, then cut out the gemheart. Easy work for a fortune. And the beasts came frequently, often several times a week, so long as the weather didn’t get too cold.`

`Tiny, near-invisible spren were floating out of the beast’s body, vanishing into the air. They looked like the tongues of smoke that might come off a candle after being snuff ed. Nobody knew what kind of spren they were; you only saw them around the freshly killed bodies of greatshells.`


`They could have taken turns, but that was not the Alethi way. Competition was doctrine to them. Vorinism taught that the finest warriors would have the holy privilege of joining the Heralds after death, fighting to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls from the Voidbringers. The highprinces were allies, but they were also rivals. [...] And so what had been a war had become sport instead. Deadly sport—but that was the best kind.`

`Killing the King’s Wit was legal. But by so doing, Sadeas would forfeit his title and lands. Most men found it a poor enough trade not to do it in the open. Of course, if you could assassinate a Wit without anyone knowing it was you, that was something different.`

`This was Gavilar’s life’s work, uniting the highprinces…”`


Kings suspicions: `Elhokar narrowed his eyes, looking at Dalinar, then at Adolin. It was almost as if the king were suspicious of them. The look was gone in a second. Had Adolin imagined it? Stormfather! he thought.`


`The book did not have a good reputation, and not just because it was associated with the Lost Radiants. Stories of a king doing the work of a menial laborer were the least of its discomforting passages. In other places, it outright said that lighteyes were beneath darkeyes. That contradicted Vorin teachings.`

`We’ve gotta prepare men to fight for the Tranquiline Halls. We’ve gotta send soldiers to the Heralds`
