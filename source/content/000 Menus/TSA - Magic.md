# Stormlight
- Only able to be held for a short time, a few minutes at most. It leaks away from the human body, which is unable to contain it
- Using Stormlight too quickly strains the body

## Lashings
### Basic Lashing
- Change the direction of gravity for oneself or another object you are touching
- Must look in the direction of the change, to choose a point to lash to?
- Multiple Lashings can be applied to the same object to make the gravitational pull stronger
- Lashing someone does not make all their objects such as weapons Lashed as well (spear falls from the lashed soldier when de drops it)
- Requires more Stormlight the larger or heavier the lashed object is

### Full Lashing
- Bounds objects toghether, holding them fast until the Stormlight runds out
- Takes longer to create than a Basic Lashing, and consumes far more Stormlight

### Reverse Lashing
- Pulls objects towards the Lashing
- Requires constant touch, but consumes little Stormlight

## Physical form
- His speed increased, his muscles bursting with energy
- Enhanced strenght (`Stormlight-enhanced kick`)
- Ability to quickly recover from small wounds, although does not restore limbs killed by a Shardblade
- Makes you tougher (pewter-like ability, as Szeth resists a punch that would have “killed an ordinary man”)

# Soulcasting
Special magic that allows to transform one material into another. Consumes stormlight infued gemstones?

- `The gemstones set into Jasnah’s Soulcaster were enormous, some of the largest that Shallan had ever seen, worth many spheres each. One was smokestone, a pure glassy black gemstone. The second was a diamond. The third was a ruby. All three were cut—a cut stone could hold more Stormlight—into glistening, many-faceted oval shapes.`
- `Nine out of ten Soulcasters were capable of a few limited transformations: creating water or grain from stone; forming bland, single-roomed rock buildings out of air or cloth. A greater one, like Jasnah’s, could effectuate any transformation. Literally turn any substance into any other one.`
- Food can be created with emeralds: `Emeralds were the most valuable, for they could be used by Soulcasters to create food.`

# Old Magic
- `of the Old Magic from their legends [in Selay] and its ability to curse people`

# Objects

## Shardblades 
- Very powerful blades that can cut through any physical material, and even sever the sould of beings.
- They do not cut the living flesh just the sould of creatures. 
- Shardblades are not as powerful as Kalaks blade (or other’s Heralds Blades presumably)
- They take ten beats to be summoned
- Kills someone if it touches your spine. For arms/legs, only makes that arm unusable forever.
- Ordinary men didn’t kil Shardbearers. It had happened so infrequently that each occurence was now legendary

## Shardplate
- Glistening blue armor made of smoothly interlocking plates and no leather or mail at the joints. 
- Counters Shardblades, and is powered by Stormlight crystals in the chest.
- Counters Lashings, as they cannout be used directly on someone wearing Shardplate
- Physically enhances its user, making him stronger, supernaturally fast, 

## Fabrials
Devices that work using Stormlight as energy
- `A Soulcaster—the word was used for both the people who performed the process and the fabrial that made it possible.`
- `The town’s only fabrial clock sat here on the counter. The small device bore a single dial at the center and a glowing Smokestone at its heart; it had to be infused to keep the time. Nobody else in the town cared about minutes and hours as Lirin did.`

### Soulcaster
A type of fabrial, used for Soulcasting
