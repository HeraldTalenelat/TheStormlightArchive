# Stormlight
- Only able to be held for a short time, a few minutes at most. It leaks away from the human body, which is unable to contain it
- Using Stormlight too quickly strains the body

## Lashings
### Basic Lashing
- Change the direction of gravity for oneself or another object you are touching
- Must look in the direction of the change, to choose a point to lash to?
- Multiple Lashings can be applied to the same object to make the gravitational pull stronger
- Lashing someone does not make all their objects such as weapons Lashed as well (spear falls from the lashed soldier when de drops it)
- Requires more Stormlight the larger or heavier the lashed object is

### Full Lashing
- Bounds objects toghether, holding them fast until the Stormlight runds out
- Takes longer to create than a Basic Lashing, and consumes far more Stormlight

### Reverse Lashing
- Pulls objects towards the Lashing
- Requires constant touch, but consumes little Stormlight

## Physical form
- His speed increased, his muscles bursting with energy
- Enhanced strenght (`Stormlight-enhanced kick`)
- Ability to quickly recover from small wounds, although does not restore limbs killed by a Shardblade
- Makes you tougher (pewter-like ability, as Szeth resists a punch that would have “killed an ordinary man”)

# Soulcasting
Special magic that allows to transform one material into another. Consumes stormlight infued gemstones?

- `The gemstones set into Jasnah’s Soulcaster were enormous, some of the largest that Shallan had ever seen, worth many spheres each. One was smokestone, a pure glassy black gemstone. The second was a diamond. The third was a ruby. All three were cut—a cut stone could hold more Stormlight—into glistening, many-faceted oval shapes.`
- `Nine out of ten Soulcasters were capable of a few limited transformations: creating water or grain from stone; forming bland, single-roomed rock buildings out of air or cloth. A greater one, like Jasnah’s, could effectuate any transformation. Literally turn any substance into any other one.`
- Food can be created with emeralds: `Emeralds were the most valuable, for they could be used by Soulcasters to create food.`

# Old Magic
- `of the Old Magic from their legends [in Selay] and its ability to curse people`

# Objects

## Shardblades 
- Very powerful blades that can cut through any physical material, and even sever the sould of beings.
- They do not cut the living flesh just the sould of creatures. 
- Shardblades are not as powerful as Kalaks blade (or other’s Heralds Blades presumably)
- They take ten beats to be summoned
	- `Ten heartbeats. That was how long it took to summon a Shardblade. If Dalinar’s heart was racing, the time was shorter. If he was relaxed, it took longer.`
- Kills someone if it touches your spine. For arms/legs, only makes that arm unusable forever.
- Ordinary men didn’t kil Shardbearers. It had happened so infrequently that each occurence was now legendary

## Shardplate
- Glistening blue armor made of smoothly interlocking plates and no leather or mail at the joints. 
- Counters Shardblades, and is powered by 5 Stormlight crystals in the chest.
- Counters Lashings, as they cannout be used directly on someone wearing Shardplate
- Physically enhances its user, making him stronger, supernaturally fast
	- `One’s muscles reacted with increased speed, strength, and dexterity when wearing the armor, and it took practice to use it correctly.`
	- `Plate-assisted legs propelling him up some eight feet`
	- `the Plate lending him the strength of many men`
- Puede romperse con golpes normales, no solo Sharblades
	- `The king rolled, cape wrapping around his body, then came to rest. He lay dazed for a moment; the armor was cracked on one shoulder, leaking Stormlight. The Plate would have cushioned the fall. He’d be all right.`
- `No! he thought, getting a gauntleted hand beneath himself and heaving, using the momentum of his slide to throw himself upright. As the sky spun, something seemed to right, as if the Plate itself knew which way was up. He landed—still moving, feet grinding on stone.`
- It regenerates automatically
	- `The lad’s breastplate still bore a web of cracks, though it had stopped leaking Stormlight. With time, the armor would repair itself. It could reform even if it was completely shattered.`

## Shardbows (Grandbows)
`They had brought grandbows: large steel bows with thick strings and such a high draw weight that only a Shardbearer could use them, to fire shafts as thick as three fingers. They were recent creations, devised by Alethi engineers through the use of fabrial science, and each required a small infused gemstone to maintain the strength of its pull without warping the metal. Adolin’s aunt Navani—the widow of King Gavilar, mother of Elhokar and his sister Jasnah—had led the research to develop the bows.`

## Fabrials
Devices that work using Stormlight as energy
- Fabrial Clock: `The town’s only fabrial clock sat here on the counter. The small device bore a single dial at the center and a glowing Smokestone at its heart; it had to be infused to keep the time. Nobody else in the town cared about minutes and hours as Lirin did.`
- Freezer: `Chilled, using one of the new fabrials that could make things cold.`
- Heater: `Several large rubies glowed brightly, set atop poles, with worked golden tines holding them in place. They were fabrials that gave off heat, though there was no fire involved. He didn’t understand how fabrials worked, though the more spectacular ones needed large gemstones to function.`
- Robot: 

### Soulcaster
A type of fabrial, used for Soulcasting
- `A Soulcaster—the word was used for both the people who performed the process and the fabrial that made it possible.`
- `Beyond that, the larger a gemstone was when used by a Soulcaster, the less likely it was to shatter. Enormous gemheart stones offered near-limitless potential.`
