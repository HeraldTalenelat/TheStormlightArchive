# Spren

Tiny spirit materialitzation of things. Spren are said to always be around, but usually invisble and many of the larger ones such as windspren or riverspren are invisible to anyone except to the person they were tormenting. In addition, they can’t be touched or feeled (at least most of the time). There are different types:

`Gloryspren—like tiny golden translucent globes of light—began to pop into existence around him, attracted by his sense of accomplishment.` → **attracted by his sense of accomplishment**

- **Greatshellspren** (deathspren?): `Tiny, near-invisible spren were floating out of the beast’s body, vanishing into the air. They looked like the tongues of smoke that might come off a candle after being snuffed. Nobody knew what kind of spren they were; you only saw them around the freshly killed bodies of greatshells.`

## Quotes
- `Were windspren attracted to gusts of wind, or were they the gusts of wind?`
- Syl: `Have you cut off a piece of the night’s cloeak and tucked it away? Is it the heart of a beetle, so tiny eyt so powerful?`

# Animals

- **Cremling** [[Pasted image 20250521145849.png|(image)]]: Palm sized terrestrial shrimp-like creatures. They feed on dead soldiers bodies (`shooing away the cremlings feeding on the bodies`)
- **Chull** [[Pasted image 20250521150834.png|(image)]]: Big crustacean-like animals. Slow to move, but very docile and useful for moving wagons.
    - `The red-carapaced chulls fidgeted, their antennae waving back and forth. The box-shaped animals had bulging, stony shells and thick, trunklike red legs. From what Kaladin had heard, their claws could snap a man’s arm. But chulls were docile, particularly domesticated ones, and he’d never known anyone in the army to get more than a halfhearted pinch from one.`
- **Skyeels** [[Pasted image 20250521152654.png|(image)]]: Eat rats or fish
- **Haspers**: Small, two-shelled snail-like creatures that come out after Highstorms, and specially during the Weeping
- **Legger**: small crustacean with many legs
    - `A legger—its hairlike spines lifted to the air to give warning of changes in the wind—climbed along the side of the cart, its long body lined with dozens of pairs of legs. That was familiar enough, but he’d never seen a legger with such a deep purple carapace.` (Kaladin in the Unclaimed Hills)
- **Horses**: They are extremely valuable, way more than chulls, only used by rich lighteyes
- **Mink**: Comadreja
- **Digger-worms**: Infect crops
- **Axelhound**: Perros pretty much 
	- `The large axehound rolled about, gnawing at the object, antennae pulled back flat against her skull.`
	- `She was sleek and lean, six legs extending before her as she sat on her haunches. Axehounds didn’t have shells or skin; instead, their body was covered with some fusion of the two, smooth to the touch and more pliable than true carapace, but harder than skin and made of interlocking sections. The axehound’s angular face seemed curious, her deep black eyes regarding Balat. She trumped softly.`
- **Spikemane**: Creature of the Purelake: `Careful not to put his weight down before he was sure he wasn’t stepping on a spikemane or a sharp lip of rock.`
- **Minnows**: Unvaluable fish of the Purelake: `Minnows shot out around his toes. Common types, not worth anything`
- **Kolgril**: Valuable fish in the Purelake: `A kolgril was a very lucky fish. Cured aching joints for a good month after you ate it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the clouds. Maib had quite a fondness for them, on account of the finger aches Nu Ralik had sent her. One kolgril would be two weeks of soup, and would put her in debt to him.`
- **Stumpy cort** : Fish in the purelkae: `“I’ll bet a stumpy cort could do it. Might take me a while to find one, though.”`
- **Songling**: Como cangrejos que cantan? `The fist-sized creature was shaped like a peaked disc with four arms that reached out from the sides and scraped rhythms along the top. Four squat legs underneath normally held it to a rock wall`
- **Ryshadium Horse:**
	- `He charged past the king. Elhokar’s stallion was a good breed, but it could never match Gallant, who was a full Ryshadium, two hands taller and much stronger than an ordinary horse. The animals chose their own riders, and only a dozen men in all of the warcamps were so fortunate. Dalinar was one, Adolin another.`
	- `The other horses—even the warhorses—panicked, but Adolin’s white Ryshadium stallion held steady`
	- `Dalinar grabbed the reins and heaved himself into the air with Plate-enhanced legs, jumping up into the saddle. The force of his landing might have strained the back of a regular horse, but Gallant was made of stronger stone than that.`
	- `Like most of them, he thought of Ryshadium as just another breed of horse. A man couldn’t really understand until he’d had one accept him as rider. It was like wearing Shardplate, an experience that was completely indescribable.`
- **Chasmfiend**: A type of greatshell?
	- `These ‘oversized chulls’ grow to fifty feet tall and are capable of crushing even a man in Shardplate.”`
	- `Something dark—something mind-numbingly enormous—rose out of the chasm on thick, chitinous legs. It climbed onto the plateau`
	- `The chasmfiend towered like a mountain of interlocking carapace the color of dark violet ink.`
	- `It had a twisted, arrowhead-like face, with a mouth full of barbed mandibles. While it was vaguely crustacean, this was no bulky, placid chull. It had four wicked foreclaws set into broad shoulders, each claw the size of a horse, and a dozen smaller legs that clutched the side of the plateau.`
	- `The monster was long and narrow like a cray-fish, and had a flattened tail. It walked on fourteen legs.`
- **Hogs**: No hay vacas en Roshar? → `Adolin twisted one of his hogshide reins around his finger while he sat astride his horse`


# Plants

- **Rockbuds** [[Pasted image 20250521152720.png| (image)]]: Small plant with vines and a shell
- **Stumpweight**: A tree? its sap mixed with lavis seed seems some king of fertilizer
- **NAME?**: Tall grass that hides when touched
- **Winterwort**: Medicinal plant used as anesthesia. Bitter taste, `induces a deep sleep for about five hours`.
- **Blackbane**: Posion. One of Roshar's most deadly natural poisons

# Creatures

## Voidbringers
A species that can hold stormlight perfectly, with no leaking

A species that can hold stormlight perfectly, with no leaking. There are multiple types, some made of rock (Thunderclasts) mentioned in the epilogue, others of fire?
- `horrors of rock and flame, dozens of feet tall, foes whose eyes burned with hatred. The Voidbringers.`

### Thunderclast
- `The enormous stone beast lay on its side, riblike protrusions from its chest broken and cracked. The monstrosity was vaguely skeletal in shape, with unnaturally long limbs that sprouted from granite shoulders. The eyes were deep red spots on the arrowhead face, as if created by a fire burning deep within the stone.`
- `Even after all these centuries, seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver. Even after all these centuries, seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver. The beast’s hand was as long as a man was tall. He’d been killed by hands like those before, and it hadn’t been pleasant.`
- `Less frequently, he passed cracked, oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts had ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray.`
