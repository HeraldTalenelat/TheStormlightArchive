Spren are said to always be around, but usually invisble and many of the larger ones such as windspren or riverspren are invisible to anyone except to the person they were tormenting.

# Animals

- **Chull** [[Pasted image 20250521150834.png|(image)]]: Big crustacean-like animals. Slow to move, but very docile and useful for moving wagons.
    - `The red-carapaced chulls fidgeted, their antennae waving back and forth. The box-shaped animals had bulging, stony shells and thick, trunklike red legs. From what Kaladin had heard, their claws could snap a man’s arm. But chulls were docile, particularly domesticated ones, and he’d never known anyone in the army to get more than a halfhearted pinch from one.`
- **Skyeels** [[Pasted image 20250521152654.png|(image)]]: Eat rats or fish
- **Haspers**: Small, two-shelled snail-like creatures that come out after Highstorms, and specially during the Weeping
- **Legger**: small crustacean with many legs
    - `A legger—its hairlike spines lifted to the air to give warning of changes in the wind—climbed along the side of the cart, its long body lined with dozens of pairs of legs. That was familiar enough, but he’d never seen a legger with such a deep purple carapace.` (Kaladin in the Unclaimed Hills)
- **Horses**: They are extremely valuable, way more than chulls, only used by rich lighteyes

# Creatures

## Voidbringers
A species that can hold stormlight perfectly, with no leaking

A species that can hold stormlight perfectly, with no leaking. There are multiple types, some made of rock (Thunderclasts) mentioned in the epilogue, others of fire?
- `horrors of rock and flame, dozens of feet tall, foes whose eyes burned with hatred. The Voidbringers.`

### Thunderclast
- `The enormous stone beast lay on its side, riblike protrusions from its chest broken and cracked. The monstrosity was vaguely skeletal in shape, with unnaturally long limbs that sprouted from granite shoulders. The eyes were deep red spots on the arrowhead face, as if created by a fire burning deep within the stone.`
- `Even after all these centuries, seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver. Even after all these centuries, seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver. The beast’s hand was as long as a man was tall. He’d been killed by hands like those before, and it hadn’t been pleasant.`
- `Less frequently, he passed cracked, oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts had ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray.`
