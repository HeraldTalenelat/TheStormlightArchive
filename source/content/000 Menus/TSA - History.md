# Canon Events
The order seems to be Recreance → Hierocracy → Last Desolation (end of the Shadowdays) → Current Time → Everstorm?

## Recreance
- `One book she’d read claimed that Kharbranth had been founded way back into the shadowdays, years before the Last Desolation. That would make it old indeed. Thousands of years old, created before the terrors of the Hierocracy, long before—even—the Recreance. Back when Voidbringers with bodies of stone were said to have stalked the land.`
- `The five Vorin kingdoms? She’d thought there were four. Jah Keved, Alethkar, Kharbranth, and Natanatan. United by religion, they had been strong allies during the years following the Recreance. What was the fifth kingdom?`

## Hierocracy
Past important event
- `is a single volume survey of Rosharan history since the Hierocracy.`
- `One book she’d read claimed that Kharbranth had been founded way back into the shadowdays, years before the Last Desolation. That would make it old indeed. Thousands of years old, created before the terrors of the Hierocracy, long before—even—the Recreance. Back when Voidbringers with bodies of stone were said to have stalked the land.`

## Shadowdays
- `Old period, back when Kharbranth was build, years before the Last Desolation`

## Last Desolation
- `One book she’d read claimed that Kharbranth had been founded way back into the shadowdays, years before the Last Desolation. That would make it old indeed. Thousands of years old, created before the terrors of the Hierocracy, long before—even—the Recreance. Back when Voidbringers with bodies of stone were said to have stalked the land.`

## Everstorm
Seems like the end of the world type event:
- `I have seen the end and have heard it named. The Night of Sorrows, the True Desolation. The Everstorm`

# Desolation
- The war between humanity and [[TSA - Wildlife#Voidbringers (Thunderclast?)|Voidbringers]]. 
- Its a repeating process that happens every X amount of years in a cycle. 
- After fighting, the Heralds go back to a hellish type place where they are tortured between Desolations (Damnation?). 
- The cycle of Desolations can be ended somehow, or that is what Ishar thinks. It appears they end up stopping it by breaking their **Otahpact**, since Desolations stop when they do (the Last Desolation)
- There is a final Desolation, called Everstorm, True Desolation or The Night of Sorrows:
	- `I have seen the end and have heard it named. The Night of Sorrows, the True Desolation. The Everstorm`

# Ten Heralds
The ten Heralds from ancient [[Vorin theology]]. They made an **Oathpact** which makes them go to the hellish plane between Desolations (Damnation?). They are immortal, and go back to the plance when they die, which then makes their sword disappear. Their swords are stronger than regular Shardblades. There are ten of them:
- **Jezrien, the King of Heralds**, **Jezerezeh**
- **Kalak**, **Kelek**: Epilogue protagonist
- **Talenel**, **Taln**, **Talenelat**, **Talenelat’Elin, bearer of all agonies**: Left behind in the hellish plane between Desolations
- **Ishar**, **Ishi**
- **Shalash**: his statue had been removed by king [[Gavilar Kholin]]
- **Vedelev**: `By Vedelev's golden keys, Brightness!`

Additional info
- `The Heralds were wise beyond our understanding.`
- `“The Heralds were sent to teach mankind,” Lirin said. “They led us against the Voidbringers after we were cast from heaven. The Radiants were the orders of knights they founded.”“Who were demons.”“Who betrayed us,” Lirin said, “once the Heralds left.” Lirin raised a finger. “They were not demons, they were just men who had too much power and not enough sense. Either way, you are always to wash your hands. You can see the effect it has on rotspren with your own eyes, even if deathspren cannot be seen.”`

# Other Factions / groups

## Knights Radiant
A faction created by the Heralds, sometimes called simply **Radiants**. They were the first users of Shardblades, ages ago, and used them to fight `horrors of rock and flame, dozens of feet tall, foes whose eyes burned with hatred. The Voidbringers.`. Most likely refering to [[Hobbies/TSANotes/TSA - Wildlife#Voidbringers|Thunderclasts]] from the epilogue

Some of them, possibly called the **Lost Radiants** betrayed “us” (humanity?) after the Heralds left. Men corrupted by power.
- `The Radiants were the orders of knights they [Heralds] founded.”“Who were demons.”“Who betrayed us,” Lirin said, “once the Heralds left.” Lirin raised a finger. “They were not demons, they were just men who had too much power and not enough sense. Either way, you are always to wash your hands. You can see the effect it has on rotspren with your own eyes, even if deathspren cannot be seen.”`
- `though Lirin made certain that his son didn’t mix up the Heralds and the Lost Radiants`

## Surgebinders
- `The stone ridges and mounds bore numerous scars. Some were shattered, blasted-out sections where Surgebinders had fought`

## Dustbringers
- `Smoke curled from the occasional patches of growth or heaps of burning corpses. Even some sections of rock smoldered. The Dustbringers had done their work well.`

## Dawnsingers
- `“This room is called the Veil,” the servant explained softly. “That which comes before the Palanaeum itself. Both were here when the city was founded. Some think these chambers might have been cut by the Dawnsingers themselves.”`
