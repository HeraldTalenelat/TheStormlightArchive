23 year old brother of [[Shallan]]. He is crippled
- `Twenty-three years old, he thought, and already a cripple. He still felt a constant, latent ache. The break had been bad, and the surgeon had nearly decided to cut off the entire leg. Perhaps he could be thankful that hadn’t proven necessary, though he would always walk with a cane.`

Had a Shardblade at some point, but gave it to Shallan, her `baby sister`:
- `Nan Balat bruised, his coat torn. A long, silvery sword in her hand, sharp enough to cut stones as if they were water.`
- Raro de cojones pk en ingles pone “her hand” sin embargo se especifica en su capitulo que es “brother”, que es masculino

Esta como una puta cabra:
- `Nan Balat liked killing things.Not people. Never people. But animals, those he could kill.Particularly the little ones. He wasn’t sure why it made him feel better; it simply did.`

Eylita?
