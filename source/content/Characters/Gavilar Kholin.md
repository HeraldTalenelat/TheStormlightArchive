Deceased king of [[Alethkar]]. Very devout to Vorin theology and great swordsman. His last words were:
- `Brother you must find the most important words a man can say`
- `The Parshendi that makes no sense?`

In the last days of his live he was obsessed with “The Way of Kings” and the Codes
- However, for some reason: `He counted off each one, and realized there were only nine here. One was conspicuously missing. Why had Shalash’s statue been removed? King Gavilar was said to be very devout in his Vorin worship. Too devout, by some people’s standards.`

His last days:
- ` Why “he” wrote? Men didn’t write. `
- `“I didn’t realize that Uncle Gavilar followed the Codes.”“He’s the one who first showed them to me. He found them as a relic of old Alethkar, back when we’d first been united. He began following them shortly before he died.” Dalinar grew hesitant. “Those were odd days, son. Jasnah and I weren’t sure what to think of the changes in Gavilar. At the time, I thought the Codes foolishness, even the one that commanded an officer to avoid strong drink during times of war. Especially that one.” His voice grew even softer. “I was unconscious on the ground when Gavilar was murdered. I can remember voices, trying to wake me up, but I was too addled by my wine. I should have been there for him.”`
- `“It’s a quote,” Dalinar said. “From an ancient book called The Way of Kings. Gavilar favored readings from the volume near the end of his life—he spoke to me of it often.`
- `“The book was used by the Radiants as a kind of guidebook, a book of counsel on how to live their lives.”`
