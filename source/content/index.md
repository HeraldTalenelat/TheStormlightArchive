## Predicts

- **Shallan has a Shardblade:** Casi que no es ni un predict
	- Un secreto, escondido a 10 heartbeats, mas claro que el agua: `She raised her freehand to her head, suddenly overwhelmed by the weight of House Davar’s situation, her part in it, and the secret she now carried, hidden ten heartbeats away.`
	- Shallan memory, alguien que recuerda tiene lo que es claramente una Shardblade: `Nan Balat bruised, his coat torn. A long, silvery sword in her hand, sharp enough to cut stones as if they were water.`
- **Honor is one of the Shards, but there is at least two, one of which has killed Honor:** Quiza en TSA las reglas cambian, pero basandose en Mistborn, que cosa sino otra esquiarla podria matar a Honor?
- **Keep an eye on number 10:** Ten Heralds, ten gmstone, Ten Essences, algo pasa aqui, a Sanderson le gustan estos detallitos e igual que metio todo lo del 16 en Mistborn aqui hay algo con el 10.

## Thoughts
No los considero predicts como tal, pero detalles menores o ideas en mente

- **Vedelev is one of the Heralds**: No creo que sea tampoco ningun secreto sus nombres, pero lo mencionan cursing asi que most likely uno de los Heraldos
	- `By Vedelev's golden keys, Brightness!`
- Parshmendi: 
	- Why did they break the treaty? Something to do with Honor’s death? 
	- What is Alethkar looking for in the Shattered Plains? Seems of relevance to go to war in such an uncomfrotable place
	- How do Parshmendi traverse this terrain (why not used by Alethi?)? Secret tunels? Creatures/mounts (not described so far + not used by alethi)? Body strengthening magic to jump?
